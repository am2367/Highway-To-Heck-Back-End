-----COMMANDS------
===================
to get these scripts to run as commands on the terminal you will need to edit your profile file.
in the terminal with root privileges type in: vim .profile (or any text editor other than vim)
at the end of the file type in: PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
then create a folder named bin in the directory home/user/
this edits the profile file to also look at the bin folder to run a script by typing in their filename.

then you need to give each script executable permissions with either the "chmod +x scriptNAME" command or "chmod 700 scriptNAME" command
